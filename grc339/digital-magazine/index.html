                        <h3>The Evolution of Streetwear</h3>
                        <p> Streetwear has notoriously made a big jump in recent years, going from cult followings to a behemoth of an icon in the world of luxury fashion. From the birth of street style to what the future holds, here's all about the evolution of the streetwear culture through the decades. Born out of the New York Hip-hop scene, streetwear evolved with elements of Californian and Japanese fashion. Streetwear brands borrowed heavily from punk, surf, and skate culture. It is something that is always evolving according to the external influences of popular culture and subculture. The evolution of streetwear is a timeline of brands, designers, musicians, and other big names inspiring and influencing each other’s work. </p>

                        <h3>The Undeniable Politics of Fashion</h3>
                        <p> The presence of politics in fashion is of paramount importance. Both as a form of manifestation and as a form of industry regulation. Hilary Jochmans gives light on the importance of political legislation concerning fashion. “Fashion functions as a mirror to our times, so it is inherently political,” notes Andrew Bolton, Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “It’s been used to express patriotic, nationalistic, and propagandistic tendencies as well as complex issues related to class, race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality.” </p>
